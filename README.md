Mautic WordPress plugin
=======================

[Mautic](http://mautic.org) [Wordpress Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mautic/) inserts Mautic tracking image and forms to the WP website. Your Mautic instance will be able to track information about your visitors that way.

## Installation

### Via WP administration

Mautic - WordPress plugin [is listed](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mautic/) in the in the official WordPress plugin repository. That makes it very easy to install it directly form WP administration.

1. Go to *Plugins* / *Add New*.
2. Search for **WP Mautic** in the search box.
3. The "WP Mautic" plugin should appear. Click on Install.
4. Go to *Settings* / WP Mautic and fill in the Base URL of your Mautic instance.

### Via ZIP package

If the installation via official WP plugin repository doesn't work for you, follow these steps:

1. [Download ZIP package](https://github.com/mautic/mautic-wordpress/archive/master.zip).
2. At your WP administration go to *Plugins* / *Add New* / *Upload plugin*.
3. Select the ZIP package you've downloaded in step 1.
4. Go to *Plugins* and enable WP Mautic plugin.
5. Go to *Settings* / WPMautic and fill in the Base URL of your Mautic instance.

## Usage

### Mautic Tracking Image

Tracking image works right after you finish step 5 of Installation above. That means it will insert 1 px gif image loaded from your Mautic instance. You can check HTML source code (CTRL + U) of your WP website to make sure the plugin works. You should be able to find something like this:

```html
<img src="http://yourmautic.com/mtracking.gif" />
```

Plugin adds more information (current url, referal url, page title, user language) to the image URL query encoded in base 64 (not humanly readable). This way your Mautic instance receives more valuable data.

If a WP user is logged in, this plugin adds to the URL query also first name, last name, email, WP username and HS blog user name. Your Mautic must be configured to receive such information from public URL. You have to make the Mautic Lead Fields publicly updatable as mentioned in the [documentation](https://www.mautic.org/docs/leads/lead_monitoring.html#lead-fields). The *Publicly available* option is in the configuration of every lead field. The WP username and HS blog name fields are not the default Mautic fields so you'll have to create them manually. Make sure they will have aliases `wp_user` and `hsbloguser`.

### Mautic Forms

To load a Mautic Form to your WP post, insert this shortcode to the place you want the form to appear:

```
[mauticform id="1"]
```

Replace "1" with the form ID you want to load. To get the ID of the form, go to your Mautic, open the form detail and look at the URL. The ID is right there. For example in this URL: http://yourmautic.com/s/forms/view/3 the ID = 3.
